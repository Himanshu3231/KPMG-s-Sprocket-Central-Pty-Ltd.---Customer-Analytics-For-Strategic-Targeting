KPMG's Sprocket Central Pty Ltd. (My Diary of Findings and Approaches):

Exploratory Data Analysis

This process is divided into 4 steps which are:
1. Historical Customer Analysis
2. Ideal Customer Profile Analysis
3. New Customer Profile Analysis and Comparison with Historical Customer Analysis based
4. Finalize Ideal 1000 Customers based on Ideal Customer Analysis.


1. Historical Customer Analysis:

I wrote and ran multiple queries to analyze and segregate historical customers based on their purchasing behavior on multiple parameters (Eg: age wise, wealth wise, job industry wise, Gender wise), I got to know various things:

Highest Total Spending of Historical Customer's Data:
1.   Agewise: Above 35 are the highest spenders (797), following with 26-35(176), and then 18-25(27)
2. Wealth Segment wise: Mass Customers are the highest spenders(500), following with High Net Worth(251), and lastly Affluent Customer(249)
3. Job Industry Category wise:  Financial Services(206), Manufacturing(199), Health(157), Other Industy(153), Retail(97), Property(67), Entertainment(40), IT(37), Agriculture(27), Telecommunications(17)
4. Gender wise: Female are the highest spenders(503), Males are second to female(496), and there was one non specified customer as well(1)

Highest Avg Spending Historical Customer's Data:
1.   Agewise: Above 35 are the highest spenders (782), following with 26-35(181), and then 18-25(37)
2. Wealth Segment wise: Mass Customers are the highest spenders(504), following with Affluent Customer(253), and lastly High Net Worth(243)
3. Job Industry Category wise: Manufacturing(201), Financial Services(197), Other Industy(165), Health(160), Retail(94), Property(66), Entertainment(41), IT(35), Agriculture(25), Telecommunications(16)
4. Gender wise: Female are the highest spenders(515), Males are second to female(484), and there was one non specified customer as well(1)

Top Historical Customers by Frequent Purchasing Behavior:
1.   Agewise: Above 35 are the highest spenders (793), following with 26-35(184), and then 18-25(23)
2. Wealth Segment wise: Mass Customers are the highest spenders(507), following with High Net Worth(255), and lastly Affluent Customer(238)
3. Job Industry Category wise: Manufacturing(200), Financial Services(192), Other Industy(169), Health(161), Retail(95), Property(66), Entertainment(34), IT(33), Agriculture(31), Telecommunications(19)
4. Gender wise: Female are the highest spenders(514), Males are second to female(485), and there was one non specified customer as well(1)

2. Ideal Customer's Profile:

Based on the Historical Customer Analysis, the ideal customer profile would be:

- Age: Predominantly Above 35 years old. This age group consistently represents the largest segment (around 782-797 customers) across all high-value categories, indicating they are the most engaged and valuable demographic.
- Wealth Segment: Primarily "Mass Customers", followed by a nearly even split between "High Net Worth" and "Affluent Customers." This suggests that while a significant portion of valuable customers are "mass market," the higher wealth segments also contribute substantially.
- Job Industry Category: Strong concentration in "Financial Services" and "Manufacturing", with "Health" and "Other Industry" also being significant contributors to the high-value customer base.
- Gender: Slightly more Female customers are identified as high-value, but Males are a very close second, indicating that both genders contribute significantly to the valuable customer base.

3. New Customer Analysis:

Since I have no transactional history of new customer like I had earlier when I was performing analysis on the historical customer's dataset, so I will use only those columns that can describe a customer's worth or value which is "Value" column, it is like a pre-calculated score assigned to the new customers so I am judging new customers according to it and will perform analysis on various parameters (such as age wise, wealth segment wise, job industry category wise, gender wise). Here is what i have found from new customer dataset:

age wise: Above 35 are dominant here as well(787), following with 26-35(163), lastly 18-25(34)
wealth segment wise: Mass Customer is dominant(500), following with High Net Worth(249), lastly, Affluent Customer(235)
job industry category: Financial Services(202), Manufacturing(199), Other Industry(165), Health(152), Retail(78), Property(65), Entertainment(36), IT(36), Agriculture(26), Telecommunications(25)
Gender wise: Female is leading in this segment(513), followed by male(471)

4. Finalize Ideal 1000 Customers based on Ideal Customer Analysis.

After analyzing the new customer dataset i got to know a lot about the new customer, also the results here were pretty much same as the historical customer analysis. what i mean is: Females in this dataset are the dominant, Customers above age 35 are the dominant, job industry category manufacturing and financial services are still dominant, and wealth segment wise: the new customer largely fall into mass customers and high net worth category just like historical customers category.
